# The Atlantic's correction bookmarklet
Sometimes we make mistakes. Here's an easier way to insert corrections.

## How to use it
### Grab the bookmarklet
Go to [this page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/the-atlantic/corrections/index.html) and drag the bookmarklet to your toolbar.

### Move your cursor to where the error lived
Drop the typey-blinky line at the end of the sentence you want to correct, with no space after the period. Click the bookmarklet. It'll drop in an asterisk and insert, if it doesn't already exist, a horizontal line and some correction starter text at the bottom of the story.

Type away, leaving a space after the asterisk. The `<a>` tags will link to each other.

### You can do this as many times as you need
It'll just drop another correction beneath the other one.
